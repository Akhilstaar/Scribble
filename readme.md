# Takneek PS

## About

A simple drawing tool created in General Championship from Hall 2.

My involvement in this project were quite less due to my involvement in other ps.

Some of the things I did included making the repo deployment ready, hosting the website on azure server, resolving issues faced by the team in integrating the ML model with frontend & some minor frontend changes and some Backend bug fixes.

## Installation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ppopdesk/takneekps.git  --original private repo link ;)

## Dependencies
Python
Django
NumPy
Pandas
Tensorflow

## Installation
Once the repository is cloned, go the the 'takneekps' directory
You can start the server using django command

'python manage.py runserver' or 'python3 manage.py runserver' 
This will open the website locally on the default address '127.0.0.1:8000', however this may vary depending on the configuration

On the homepage of server, click the link 'Try it now!' to open a new scribble canvas.
